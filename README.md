ProductManagementApp created including these features below,
 1-Presenting the specification document which has the product’s capabilities, appearance, and user interactions
 2-Setting up Git and GitHub account to store and track your enhancements of the prototype 
 3-Explained the Java concepts used in the project 
 4-Discussing the generic features of the product:
 5-There will be an admin to manage the website. An administrator login will be required to access the admin page. 
 6-The admin able to change his password if he wants, he should be able to:
  ● Manage the products in the store including categorizing them
  ● Browse the list of users who have signed up and be able to search users
  ● See purchase reports filtered by date and category

Regarding with the code :The Product class has no attributes, but it retains the constructor to create a product.
Saved this complete code in a single file named ProductManagementApp.java. Then, compile and run the program using the commands javac ProductManagementApp.java and java ProductManagementApp. The code should execute without any warnings, allowing you to test the functionalities of the ProductManagementApp.

Now that the code is compiling and running without errors, and successfully implemented the prototype for the ProductManagementApp with the Admin's functionalities. 

The next steps depend on the development process. 

Here are some possible next steps:

1-) Testing and Validation: Ensure that all functionalities work as expected and thoroughly test the application to identify and fix any bugs or issues.

2-) User Interface (UI) Development: If the prototype involves a user interface, work on designing and implementing the UI to make the application user-friendly and visually appealing.

3-) Database Integration: If the prototype uses a database to store product information, user data, and purchase records, implement the necessary database connections and interactions.

4-) Enhancing Admin Functionalities: If there are specific requirements for the admin's functionalities (e.g., filtering products by category, date, etc.), implement those enhancements.

5-) Code Refinement: Review and optimize the code for better performance and maintainability.

6-) Documentation: Document the code, functionalities, and any relevant instructions for future reference and collaboration.

7-) Version Control: As you previously set up Git and GitHub, use version control to track changes and collaborate with team members.

8-) Presentation to Stakeholders: Prepare a presentation showcasing the prototype's capabilities, user interactions, and appearance. Highlight the value it brings to the organization and how it addresses specific business needs.

9-) Feedback and Iteration: Gather feedback from stakeholders, consider their input, and iterate on the prototype if needed. Feedback is crucial to improving the application and aligning it with the organization's requirements.

10-) Deployment Plan: Discuss and plan the deployment of the application, including hosting options, security considerations, and scalability.

I hope this helps!
